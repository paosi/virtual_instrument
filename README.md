# virtual_instrument
Project for QVault Hackathon which plays sounds based on the letters of a user's name

I created a virtual instrument using Python and the Playsound module. I downloaded a free sound package from Zapsplat.com to use as my sounds for this instrument.

Instructions:

- Install the playsound module from the terminal with command "pip install playsound".

- The main file is "name_song.py". The sound files are located in "/zapsplat" folder. Download the zip file and unzip. Please keep "name_song.py" and "/zapsplat" in the same directory so the program functions correctly.

- This program runs from the terminal. Type "chmod +x name_song.py" to make it executable.

- Run the program with the command "./name_song.py"

- The program will ask the user for their name and play a song according to user input.
