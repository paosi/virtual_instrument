# Virtual Instrument
Project for QVault Hackathon which plays sounds based on the letters of a user's name

I created a virtual instrument using Python and the Playsound module. I downloaded a free sound package from Zapsplat.com to use as my sounds for this instrument.

#### How to use:

- Install the playsound module from the terminal.

```
pip install playsound
```

- The main file is "name_song.py". The sound files are located in "/zapsplat" folder. Download the zip file and unzip. Please keep "name_song.py" and "/zapsplat" in the same directory so the program functions correctly.

- This program runs from the terminal. First, make it executable.

```
chmod +x name_song.py
```

- Run the program.

```
./name_song.py
```

- The program will ask the user for their name and play a song according to user input.
