# virtual_instrument
Project for QVault Hackathon which plays sounds based on the letters of a user's name

I created a virtual instrument using Python and the Playsound module. I downloaded a free sound package from Zapsplat.com to use as my sounds for this instrument,

Instructions:

- Install the playsound module from the terminal with command "pip install playsound".

- Download the main file, "name_song.py"

- The sound files are located in "zapsplat.zip". Download the zip file and unzip in the same directory where you will keep "name_song.py". Now, you should have a folder "/zapsplat" in the same directory as "name_song.py".

- This program runs from the terminal. Type "chmod +x name_song.py" to make it executable.

- Run the program with the command "./namesong.py"

- The program will ask the user for their name and play a song according to user input.
